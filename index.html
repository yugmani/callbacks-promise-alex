  <h1>JavaScript Promises â€“ All You Need to Know to Get Started</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
    Promises are objects that represent some value. You don't know that value when you create a Promise. You will get this value in the future when a promise is resolved or rejected. 
    </li>
    <li>When javaScript Promise is settled, resolved or rejected, it automatically triggers events you can listen to with specific handler methods. </li>
    <li>The handlers will automatically execute any code you want at the right moment when Promise returns some value. </li>
    <li>
    <h3>Creating a Promise</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>While creating a Promise, we use Promise constructor using keyword 'new' followed by Promise().
      </li>
      <li>The constructor takes one parameter. This parameter is a function called executor. The executor is invoked automatically when you create a Promise.</li>
      <li>The executor function takes two parameters, both of which are callbacks. These parameters are resolve and reject.</li>
      <li>When Promise is resolved the resolve callback is invoked. This is when the job a Promise is supposed to do is successful. When it is not, when there is some error, Promise is rejected and the reject callback is invoked.</li>
      <li style="background-color:lightgray">
      <code>// Promise syntax example<br>
      const myPromise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {<br>
      &emsp; // ... some code<br>
      })
      </code>
      </li>
      <li style="background-color:lightgray; margin-top:5px;">
      <code>
      // Promise syntax example using an arrow function<br>
      const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {<br>
      &emsp; // ... some code<br>
      })      
      </code>
      </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
<h3>Resolving and rejecting Promises with static methods</h3>
<p>When we want the Promise to return some data, ...</p>
<ol>
  <li>we pass those data into the resolve. For example: while making a call to an API by our Promis, we pass into the resolve the data returned from the API.</li>
  <li>If some error occurs we can pass the data about the error to the reject callback. Or some error message.</li>
</ol>

    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Four States of JavaScript Promises</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>First State: <strong>Pending</strong> - Thisis the initial state when you create a Promise and invoke it. This state says that the Promise is neither fulfilled(resolved) nor rejected.</li>
        <li>Second State: <strong>Fulfilled</strong> - This is the state that Promise is successfully resolved.</li>
        <li>Third State: <strong>Rejected</strong> - This is the state when there is some problem that is preventing the Promise from being successfully fulfilled(resolved).</li>
        <li>Fourth State: <strong>Settled</strong> - This is the last state of the Promise when the job of the Promise is finished and the Promise is either fulfilled or rejected.</li>
      </ol>    
    </li>
    <li>
    <h3>Handling JavaScript Promises with Handler Functions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Handling a Promise is working with the data returned by a Promise, data passed into resolve and reject callbacks.</li>
      <li>The <code>then()</code>, <code>catch()</code> and <code>finally()</code> are handler functions we can attach to a Promise.</li>
      <li>When you invoke a Promise and the promise is settled (resolved or rejected) one of these handlers will be automatically invoked. The Promise returns data and it is passsed into the handlers. The handlers are like messengers that transport the message from Promise further down the chain. For example: adding logic for updating an app with the data received from API into these handlers.</li>
      <li>        
        <h3>The <code>then()</code> handler function</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>This handler is usually used to handle fulfilled state of JavaScript Promises. </li>
          <li>When the Promise is settled(resolved or rejected) the data will be passed to the then() handler.</li>
          <li>These data are the data passed into the resolve() handler inside the Promise. </li>
          <li>To access this data, we need to pass a callback function to the then() handler. This callback function should accept one parameter. Any data returned by the Promise(resolved) will then be available through this parameter.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
          </ol>

    </li>
  </ul>
