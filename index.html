  <h1>JavaScript Promises â€“ All You Need to Know to Get Started</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
    Promises are objects that represent some value. You don't know that value when you create a Promise. You will get this value in the future when a promise is resolved or rejected. 
    </li>
    <li>When javaScript Promise is settled, resolved or rejected, it automatically triggers events you can listen to with specific handler methods. </li>
    <li>The handlers will automatically execute any code you want at the right moment when Promise returns some value. </li>
    <li>
    <h3>Creating a Promise</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>While creating a Promise, we use Promise constructor using keyword 'new' followed by Promise().
      </li>
      <li>The constructor takes one parameter. This parameter is a function called executor. The executor is invoked automatically when you create a Promise.</li>
      <li>The executor function takes two parameters, both of which are callbacks. These parameters are resolve and reject.</li>
      <li>When Promise is resolved the resolve callback is invoked. This is when the job a Promise is supposed to do is successful. When it is not, when there is some error, Promise is rejected and the reject callback is invoked.</li>
      <li style="background-color:lightgray">
      <code>// Promise syntax example<br>
      const myPromise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {<br>
      &emsp; // ... some code<br>
      })
      </code>
      </li>
      <li style="background-color:lightgray; margin-top:5px;">
      <code>
      // Promise syntax example using an arrow function<br>
      const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {<br>
      &emsp; // ... some code<br>
      })      
      </code>
      </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
<h3>Resolving and rejecting Promises with static methods</h3>
<p>When we want the Promise to return some data, ...</p>
<ol>
  <li>we pass those data into the resolve. For example: while making a call to an API by our Promis, we pass into the resolve the data returned from the API.</li>
  <li>If some error occurs we can pass the data about the error to the reject callback. Or some error message.</li>
</ol>

    </li>
  </ul>
